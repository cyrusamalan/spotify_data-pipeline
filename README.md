# spotify_data-pipeline
Designed and implemented a data pipeline to collect and analyze user data from the Spotify API, enabling insights into music preferences and user behavior. I implemented AWS-driven mechanism to automate daily analyses of song rankings from the Spotify API. By taking advatage of AWS lambda for scheduled tasks, the system fetched and stored song rankings at intervals. This end-to-end automation within AWS not only streamlined data processing but also enabled real-time trend analysis.
